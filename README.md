# 🌱 Soil Fertility Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict the fertility level of soil based on its chemical properties.

## 📊 Models Compared
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 🏆 Final Accuracy
Random Forest gave the highest accuracy at *93%* and is selected as the most suitable model.
